0,Johnny Cash,Bird On A Wire,"Like a bird on a wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried in my way to be free Like a fish on a hook Like a knight from an old fashioned book I have saved all my ribbons with thee, And if I have been unkind I hope that you will just let it go by And if I have been untrue I hope you know it was never to you, Like a baby stillborn Like a beast with his horn I have torn everyone who reached out for me, But I swear by this song By all I have done wrong I'll make it all up to you, I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch He called out to me  Don't ask for so much  And a young man leaning on his darkened door He cried out to me ' Hey, why not ask for more '
Like a bird on a wire Like a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried in my way to be free",1994
1,Johnny Cash,Delia's Gone,"Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life , If I hadn't have shot poor 
Delia I'd have had her for my wife , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone, I went up to Memphis , And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor , And I tied to her chair , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone, She was low down and trifling , And she was cold and mean , Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side , Hard to watch her suffer , But with the second shot she died , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone, But jailer, oh, jailer Jailer,I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside , I hear the patter of Delia's feet , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone, So if you woman's devilish , You can let her run , Or you can bring her down and do her , Like Delia, got done , Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone",1994
2,Johnny Cash,Down There By The Train,"There's a place I know where the train goes slow 
Where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb 
There's a river by the trestle down by sinner's grove 
Down where the willow and the dogwood grow

You can hear the whistle, you can hear the bell 
From the halls of heaven to the gates of hell 
And there's room for the forsaken if you're there on time 
You'll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes 
If you're down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there where the train goes slow

There's a golden moon that shines up through the mist 
And I know that your name can be on that list 
There's no eye for an eye, there's no tooth for a tooth 
I saw Judas Iscariot carrying John Wilkes Booth 
He was down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
Down there by the train 
He was down there where the train goes slow",1994
3,Johnny Cash,Drive On,"I got a friend named Whiskey Sam 
He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam 
He said is my country just a little off track 
Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
But, it's better than not coming back at all 
Many a good man 
I saw fall And even now, 
every time I dream I hear the men 
and the monkeys in the jungle scream

Drive on, don't mean nothin' 
My children love me , but they don't understand 
And I got a woman who knows her man 
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on",1994
4,Johnny Cash,Let The Train Blow The Whistle,"I don't want no aggravation 
When my train has left the station 
If you're there or not, 
I may not even know 
Have a round and remember 
Things we did that weren't so tender 
Let the train blow the whistle when I go

On my guitar sell tickets 
So someone can finally pick it 
And tell the girls down at the Ritz 
I said hello 
Tell the gossipers and liars 
I will see them in the fire 
Let the train blow the whistle when I go",1994
5,Johnny Cash,Like A Soldier,"With the twilight colors falling 
And the evening laying shadows 
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind 
As I feel my own heart beating out 
The simple joy of living 
I wonder how I ever was that kind

But the wild road I was rambling 
Was always out there calling 
And they said a hundred times I should have died 
But now my present miracle 
Is that you're here beside me So, 
I believe they were roads that I was meant to ride

Like a soldier getting over the war 
Like a young man getting over his crazy days 
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways 
Every day is better than before 
I'm like a soldier getting over the war",1994
6,Reba Mcentire,I Sacrificed More Than You'll Ever Lose,"Needing new clothes with the money you spent
On barbills and motels and women you met
But I stood the heartache that you put me through
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever loseI gave up so much
And now I'm giving up you
It's too late to make up for
The love that you used

I've had enough
I don't want you around
Don't look at me
Like I let you down
You say I'm to blame
But who's fooling who
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose
Yeah I sacrificed more than you'll ever lose",2005
7,Reba Mcentire,Is It Really Love,"And I remember when you first said that you love me
I tried not to let the words go to my head
The things you said you spoke so sincerely
Somewhere in between the lines of red

Chorus:
Is it really love
Is it really love
Or just my heart playing tricks on me
I fall so easily
Is my heart telling me 
That I'm your fool
Or is it really love",2005
8,Reba Mcentire,Love Isn't Love (Til You Give It Away),"Love isn't love till you give it away
Love isn't love till it's free
The love in your heart
Wasn't put there to stay
Oh love isn't love till you give it away

You might think love is a treasure to keep
Feeling to cherish and hold
But love is a treasure for people to share
You keep it by letting it goRepeat Chorus

Cause love can't survive
When it's hidden inside
And love was meant to be shared",2005
9,Reba Mcentire,Nickel Dreams,"It's taken a long time
And she's walked a thin line
The fame and fortune arrived

She kept on striving
Way of surviving
Till part of those dreams came alive

Chorus:
And she wishes she looks like 
They tell her she looks like all the time
What she'd give just to feel like 
She tells them she's feeling
Just fine
All that money she makes every night
Ain't as much as it seems
A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dreamHer heart may be breaking
But she keeps on taking
What she thought she wanted way back when
It's too late to change her
There's always a stranger
To tell her she's someone again",2005
10,Reba Mcentire,One Good Reason,"So give me one good reason why I should stay
Just one good reason not to walk away
Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease
And why do you do me this way
Just give me one good reason to stay
And I'll stayYou tell me your love is true
Well is that what you tell all the other girls too
You can't tell the truth babe 
You're not even trying
I got a feeling you're just alibing",2005

17,Shakira,Controlas Mi Destino,"Cuando pienso que este asunto
se puede solucionar
te me acercas y echas todo marcha atras
y el temor me hizo en eso mucho mas fuerte que tu
pero me vas a vencer asi nomas
pero ahora me doy cuenta
que mi pulso se acelera y tiemblo
se me atrofian mis sentidos
se detienen mis latidos
no soporto que tu controles mi destino.
Ten un poco de compasion por mi
no ves que estoy a punto de desistir
me encuentro inmovil de cabeza a los pies
y ya sinceramente no se que hacer.
Ten un poco de compasión por mi
no ves que estoy a punto de desistir
me encuentro inmovil de cabeza a los pies
y ya sinceramente no se que hacer.",1993
18,Shakira,Eres,"Eres sensacional
un loco de ideas raras
muy original
eres sentimental
tambien transparente
pero tan diferente
a todo el que conozco
igual yo reconozco
cuando estoy sin ti
no me siento viva
no me siento plena
solo tu me llenas
que eres mi prisión
y dulce condena.

Que es lo que te hace
ser tan especial
paralizas mi alma
solo con hablar
Que tienen tus ojos
que hacen derretirme
y me encantas tu
tu estilo de amar
Que es lo que te hace ser
tan sonador
dices lo que piensas
sin ningun temor
eres brisa y calma
eres fuego y emoción
vi su oscuridad
y oi calor.",1993
19,Shakira,Este Amor Es Lo Mas Bello Del Mundo,"Empezar a amar
descubrir esta verdad
que recien ya te conozco
y ya no hay mas.
Y es pensar, sentir
que eres tu mi ultimo fin
dulce imagen que solto un video-clip.
Creeme que te quiero
que en mi eres VIP
la ternura en mi espejo
que me sonrie feliz.
Porque se que este amor es lo mas bello del mundo
desato el corazon
para amar cada segundo
porque se que este amor que es tan mio como tuyo
no es pasion sin querer
trapecista sin red
en los dos, en los dos.",1993
20,Shakira,Eterno Amor,"Hace tiempo que nos conocemos
que estamos los dos
en algo que parece una amistad.
Compartimos mil secretos
nos contamos mil cosas
es hora de decirte la verdad.
Algo nuevo estoy sintiendo
mi corazon te quiere hablar
que por ti esta latiendo
y te quiere preguntar
que vas ha hacer el resto de tu vida
que vas ha hacer desde ahora y para siempre
yo quiero saber
si un milagro puede ser
que este sueno sea
el comienzo de un eterno amor.",1993
21,Shakira,Peligro,"Me encanta tumbarme al sol
pelo suelto y bronceador
con mi walkman amarillo
toalla, arena en mi oído
cuando pasas que se yo
siento conmocion que no
dedicabas tu sonrisa
yo me hago la distraída
delatando al corazon
y me pongo mis jeans
y corro, corro
no me sigas no, no, no
No se como 
en tus ojos
de arenas movedizas
siento todo
y aqui en la cuerda floja
estoy que horror",1993
22,Shakira,Quince Años,"Este nuevo amanecer
es abrir la puerta de mis años
sin saber por que
esta vida nunca pasa en vano
siempre hay un despues
y vivir en este mundo
es algo muy dificil de ejercer.
Busco eternas primaveras
que renazcan a la vida
huracan de emociones
me confunden, me dominan.
Mi vida es transparente todavia
la flor que se abre a plena luz del dia
mi primer amor
lo siento tan directo al corazon.
Hoy descubro que es amar
un abrazo, una caricia plena
algo mas que dar
es el sueno que ahora me libera
mi otra verdad
en mis quince soy mujer en realidad.",1993
